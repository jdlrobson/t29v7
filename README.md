# t29v7: The seventh iteration of the technikum29 museum website

This repository holds a [skin](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Skins) for the [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/)
installation for the successor of the `t29v6` website. The codes of the `t29v6` website can be seen at
https://github.com/technikum29/technikum29-www (especially `/lib` and `/shared/{css,js}-v6`).

The basic idea of this skin is: Take the old and mature design and put it onto MediaWiki, salted with some
modern mobile design attempts, i.e. adopting flexbox and mobile first. Thanks to the home brown structure
of `t29v6`, which was already inspired by MediaWiki templating, the transition was not that hard.
